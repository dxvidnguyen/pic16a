    "\n",
    "Write a Car class. This car should have the following attributes and properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A class variable called `wheels` with value `4` (since all cars have four wheels). \n",
    "- An instance variable `make` (string), e.g. `\"Toyota\"`, `\"Subaru\"`, `\"Chevy\"`). \n",
    "- An instance variable `model` (string), e.g. `\"Corolla\"`, `\"Outback\"`, `\"Tahoe`\"). \n",
    "- An instance variable `year` (integer) the year the car was manufactured e.g. 2010). \n",
    "- An instance variable `miles_per_gallon` (float) the number of miles the car can drive per gallon of gas: e.g. 18.0)\n",
    "- An instance variable `current_gas_level` (float), the number of gallons currently in the tank of the car. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your function should have an `__init__` method which  checks that `make` and `model` are strings, that `year` is an integer which is greater than 1900, that `current_gas_level` and `miles_per_gallon` are floats or ints, and that `current_gas_level`$\\geq0$. You should also check that `miles_per_gallon`>0. Make sure to raise *informative* errors if any of these checks fail.  You should appropriately use both type errors and value errors in your solution. \n",
    "2. Write a `drive()` method. This method should accept an argument `number_of_miles` giving the desired number of miles to drive. The `current_gas_level` should be reduced by an appropriate amount. If the `current_gas_level` is not sufficient to drive the specified number of miles, then raise an informative error of an appropriate type, and do not change `current_gas_level`. \n",
    "3. Demonstrate **one example** of successfully constructing an object of class `Car` and **three different examples** of raising an error from checks in the `__init__` method. \n",
    "4. Demonstrate **one example** of sucessfully calling the `drive` method, printing the  `current_gas_level` before and after. Demonstrate **one example** in which there is not enough gas and the corresponding error is raised. \n",

    "### Specs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments and docstrings, please!** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remember that the class itself should have a docstring describing its overall purpose, instance variables, and methods. \n",
    "2. Each method (with the possible exception of `__init__` should have a docstring describing its purpose, inputs, and outputs/other effects. "
