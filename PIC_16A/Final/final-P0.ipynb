    "I liked learning about the data structures from the live lectures. I feel that data strcutres are much more intiuitive and easy to understand using python. For example, I did not really understand hash maps and how to use them in C++, but I really enjoy dicts and feel that I have a certain level of mastery in dicts where as I would just pray my hash maps worked. This will definitely help if I can achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer.\n",

    "I also learned how to be more efficient in this class. I never realized but before I would just code in the most intuitive (often simple but with huge time and space complexities) just to power through and get my work done. This class really emphasized keeping my code as concise as possible and it really made me think about the best possible way. Even though I would go back and forth between different methods, I have learned to be more flexible and catch patterns to make my code run faster and better"

    "I honestly did not understand machine learning and it was a really hard concept to wrap my mind around. I had a really hard time understanding what a model was and did. I knew the textbook definition but I really struggled seeing how it was applied. Especially with training models by hand and using the models from the sklearn kits. What helped me most was asking classmates for help! We had a group me and people were really nice and helped break down concepts for me and I truly appreciate all their time. I feel struggling with this and having school be online allowed me to reach out to more people. Theres less pressure than asking for help in real life and it was really cool just to learn as I interacted with classmates. It was also reassuring when a classmate did not understand because then we could piece ideas together. "

    "I feel like I should have earned probably a B (I hope my real grade is an A and I really think I did good in my final but a B for the context of this question). I watched all the lectures. I attended office hours when I needed help. I checked campus wire and asked classmates for help on groupme. I followed all the instructions. \n",

    "I do admit though, I wasn't 100% perfect. I had to drop homeworks and dicussions in order to balance everything else I have going. Although I only dropped because I knew I was allowed to, I should  have done everything regardless of the drop policy ideally. I am slightly disappointed in myself for taking advantage of the drop policy where as it should have been a safety blanket. I usally just chase after a good grade and taking advantage of the drop policy just comes from my desperation to get good grades. Therefore in the context of this question I feel like I would not deserve an A due to lack academic enthusiasm. Don't get me wrong though, I did calculate how much I would need on the final and I knew what I needed to get an A going in and that is all I went for. Going for partial credit on the final was a strategic move but does cast away any interest for the mastery of the subject, which I feel is a super important factor in this question. \n",

    "Something I am proud of is doing all the quizzes. Even if I got a few low scores, I did every single quiz and kept up with the material. I feel like I've learned a lot in this class.

    "Something I did slightly struggle with was I feared starting and would procrastinate, but when I started the homework, it was just tedious and not overwhelmingly difficult. Now I will be more confident and manage my time better. The group project as well was super cool. The way my group operated was that we split up work and then came together. It was interesting to see how we had to all learn and intrepret the other people's code in order to help or debug. In this process, I saw how much my groupmates commented and then realized I sometimes had an issue with overcommenting. Overcommenting makes my code hard to read and overall ugly. Seeing how much or little my groupmates commented helped me realized how much i should comment so someone else could understand my code. Overall I really enjoyed the class and am glad to be able to retain the material for more than just midterms and finals."
